for example, there are whatsapp group of 100 peaople if the same copy of data will send to the whatsapp group then everyone has get digital signature for downloading the data from group. In that case 
if anyone out of 100 people get wrong digital signature then remainig 99 people of group can be replace there data and then verifaible attained.
